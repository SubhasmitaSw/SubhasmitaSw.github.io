## About me

Hi, I'm Subhasmita. I'm glad you are visiting my website, below listed are a couple of my current positions of responsibility and some of my activities I am proud of. Lately I've been interested in MLOps and pipeline management for machine learning, which I believe has a lot of value for organizations in terms of actually delivering ML solutions and ensuring they don't set everything on fire. I also work with cloud infrastructure and devops, and I'm a huge admirer of the serverless approach.

I‚Äôm best reached via [email](mailto:subhasmitaswain232@gmail.com). I‚Äôm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.

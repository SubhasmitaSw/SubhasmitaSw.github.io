title: About Me
---

I’m really glad you stopped by my website! Here are a few of the roles I’m currently taking on, along with some projects I’m especially proud of. Lately, I’ve been diving into MLOps and pipeline management for machine learning—an area I believe can really help organizations by ensuring they deliver effective ML solutions without causing chaos. I also work with cloud infrastructure and DevOps, and I’m a big fan of the serverless approach.

I’m best reached via [email](mailto:subhasmitaofc@gmail.com). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.

To know about my projects, refer to my [Github profile](https://github.com/SubhasmitaSw). 😊

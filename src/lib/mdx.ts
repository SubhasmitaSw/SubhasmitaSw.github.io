## How I Met Your Software â€“ an Image's Sitcom of Consuming and Securing Software in Cloud Native!
*[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024](https://sched.co/1YeRc)*

Hi, I am an OCI Image and before I am fed as a Kubernetes workload, here's my story - how I met your software - whether it was curl-bash-piped or 'apk'ed, 'apt'ed, 'yum'med or 'brew'ed? The plot airs this KubeCon delving from the tradeoffs of consuming software via distro vs. via projects to how I was fine-grained further as Kubernetes workloads.Exploring the rise of open-source software and projects like NPM, Maven, PyPI, the discussion centers on the dilemma of obtaining the latest software: opting for external installations for quick updates versus relying on more reliable distributions with robust supply chain checks for enhanced security. The presenters will dissect the techniques of choosing the consumer software by comparing various distributions like Alpine, Wolfi and how a few of them are solving for maintaining the pace with upstream projects. So join me, the Image, in this journey on how I am smoothly and securely rocketed into the cloud and become its native!
